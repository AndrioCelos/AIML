# Example Bot

This bot gives an example of the standard set of files and configuration that the AIML library looks for when loading a bot.

Not all content, such as substitutions, sets, maps and triples, shown here is required for any bot; it is intended to show examples of how to add similar content.

The example bot may be started with the console application using a command similar to the following:

	dotnet AimlConsoleBot.dll ExampleBot
